# DS & A in .NET #
* Learn to use common .NET types and create/design algorithms using VB.NET.
* Learn how to use .NET collections, and compiling/running .NET programs and 
  assemblies. .NET is useful for RPA development, since UiPath is created on the 
  .NET framework.

## .NET Programming ##
* .NET is readily available in Windows systems.
* Even in fortified systems, .NET compilers are available.
* It is publicly available on Windows systems.
    * VB, C#, full featured, compiled, OOP languages.
* Format output structure with padRight and padLeft
* `Dim` without accessor is considered private.
* RPA tools are .NET programming.

## Collections ##
* API for linear and nonlinear data structures.
* Common Methods:
  * **Add**
  * **Insert**
  * **Remove**
  * **Clear**
  * **IndexOf**
* Linear can be sequential(queue, stack) 
  or direct access(array, list, string, structure).
* NonLinear can be hierarchial or grouped.
* `StringBuilder` class can help speed up automations.

## VB.NET Programming ##
* All VB.NET programs must contain a module or class. Program is composed of 
  objects.
* `me` is `this`.. `mybase` is parent class.
* `my` has access to different parts of the computer like application and
  environment variables.
* **Modules** are like static global classes within a namespace. Can only
  be instantiated once.
* Variables in a module are visible to all other parts of program, and only one
  instance of the variable exists.
* **Private constructor** creates static classes.
* **Modules** can be used for constants, enums, and global variables.
